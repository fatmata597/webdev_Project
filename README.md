# webdev_Project
This is my Project for web_dev:
My Project is Sierra Essentails, if you check I am just starting as I was using a template but I was finding it difficult to edit it and decided to start from scratch.
Following Bobson advice, I am focusing on the functionality of the website and will be working on how it looks.
However, I implemented my usecase as this assignment stated!
This is a working progress project and it will be improve over time.
